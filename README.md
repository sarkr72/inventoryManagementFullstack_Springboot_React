# Inventory Management System ‚Äì Full Stack Project

## üßæ Overview

This is a full-stack Inventory Management System built using **Spring Boot** (backend) and **React** (frontend). The application supports role-based access control and real-time updates, and integrates several AWS services to create a scalable, event-driven architecture.

- **Tech Stack**
  - **Frontend**: React, Vite, WebSocket (SockJS + STOMP)
  - **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, JPA
  - **Database**: Amazon Aurora (MySQL-compatible) with separate **read/write endpoints**
  - **Authentication**: Secure JWT token-based authentication system

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Integration

This project utilizes several AWS services:

- **Amazon RDS (Aurora MySQL)**

  - Sends out notifications (e.g., email alerts) when inventory items are uploaded.

- **WebSocket + STOMP**  
  - Real-time inventory updates pushed to frontend from backend.
